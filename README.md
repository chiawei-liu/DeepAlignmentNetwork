# Manga Facial Landmarks Detection Based on Part-Based Correction and Deep Alignment Network

This is an implementation of my thesis for my bachelor's degree. The thesis is written in Chinese and not published publicly, but feel free to contact me if interested in more details.

This repo is forked from [Deep Alignment Network](https://github.com/MarekKowalski/DeepAlignmentNetwork) and added with the methods proposed in [Combining Data-driven and Model-driven Methods for Robust Facial Landmark Detection](https://github.com/HongwenZhang/ECT-FaceAlignment) in search for improvements for Manga facial landmarks detection.
